# TO DO - Senior Project Milestones
------------------------------------

> Plan and implement ->
  - UI/UX : Wireframe (app's layout), Prototyping (to visualize UX), 
            user testing (let people use and get feedback), mockup & design
            specifications.
  - Front-End : Implementation based on UI/UX, consistent with the design specification  
                to increase time and resource efficiency. 

> Build Android App
	
> Plan & execute Integration ->
  - Database : Firebase (online) & SQLite (offline)
  - Back-End : Business logic

> ROS Simulation testing (on PC) then Integration (on Raspberry Pi/Hardware)
  - Simulation: on Chat-GPT -> How to "To simulate the Android app communicating with ROS running on a Raspberry Pi (or your PC) without needing the physical hardware yet, you can still use your actual Android app and test everything in a simulated environment. Show a step-by-step guide on how to achieve that"
  - Integration
